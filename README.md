## Introduction
The project is using CNN network to do disease diagnosis from x-rays. The training data is obtained from a dataset, "ChestX-ray8". This is a multilable prediction model, which means an image could indicates more than 1 diseases. YOLO network is used to detect the pathologic areas in x-rays.

## The main executable files:
*train.py is the main train file
*model.py and modelX.py is the CNN network architecure files
*text_generator.py is the implementation of text extraction
*image_resize.py is the image preprocess funtion
*display.py is the plot function
